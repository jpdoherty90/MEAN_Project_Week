# Pinnackle

  This was a project I built with two of my Coding Dojo friends, Jessica Simpson and Alyssa Nickow.  We had planned to
build a clone of Pinterest, and because the Rick & Morty episode "Pickle Rick" had just come out, we decided to put our own
spin on Pintest where everything was related to pickles, and we called in Pinnackle.  The project was a one-week sprint. We
built the project with Node.js, Express.js, Angular.js, and MongoDB.

  My main contibution was writing the User model, the login and registration pages, saving user info and preferences to the
databse, and writing front-end and back end validations for User info and preferences.  I also wrote the search functionality
that allows a user to filter boards/pins by topic.

  This project is not currently deployed although deploying it to Heroku is on my immediate to-do list and should be completed
within a week of this writing.

  This project was a great learning experience and went a long way towards helping us understand how all the moving parts of
a fullstack JavaScript application work together.  If we could do it again, I would probably try to make it more modular and
break up the larger function and files in smaller bits with better defined purposes.
